# CHANGELOG

## 0.71

 - Change around the way default material selection works will a few spells.
 - Make rewind and transmute targetable by default. Remove revert.
 - Remove wip spells. I can add them back as I test them- I'm tired of people reporting bugs on them...
 - Fix an NPE when trying to access permissions for a player who had none!

## 0.70

 - Disallow air selection by default- right now, only transmute and fillwith allow it. I'm not sure how intuitive this is!

## 0.69

 - Add revert, a targeted variant of rewind.
 - Add blob and superblob, variants of construct.
 - Add manifest, for getting a material by name.

## 0.65
 
 - More work on the undo system, make the cave-in-proof thing optional.
 - Add paint and shell spells.
 - Fix variants with multiple parameters.
 - Re-arrange spell materials, again- now that I can use right-clickable items again.

## 0.64

 - Improved the undo system to automatically add sticky blocks to the undo list, as well
  as auto-fill in sand and gravel that would fall with dirt.
