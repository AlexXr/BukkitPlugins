# CHANGELOG

# 0.29

 - Fix using an object as an id and then embedding the containg object inside another object. I fixed this with recursion, so
   it should handle any depth of craziness like this now.

# 0.28

 - Don't preload a World when calling getWorld, just create the shadow data. 

# 0.27

 - Don't persist command.children, it can be built at runtime from the parents.
 - Permissions integration (Permissions.hasPermission, and CommandData.permissionNode)
 - Remove NetherGate-specific stuff from WorldData- my bad! I promise not to abuse my dual dev/client status in the future :)

# 0.26
 
  - Prefix contained value names
  - Persist Player location and position
  - Really fix persisting longs and floats
  - Add built-in WorldData type. Little bit o' portal-specific stuff in here, I will admit.
  - Add ability to create and track server Worlds
  - Need to clone fields when cloning a class, or ownership trees get screwed up (BlockVector, again!!)
  - Correctly bind messages to their owning plugins
  - Fix concurrency issues when trying to access commands (e.g. auto help) from within a command handler
  - Allowed contained enums
  - Support using a class an an id
  - Fixed containing an object with a read-only id
  - BlockVector!
 
# 0.25

 - LOTS of refactoring. I honestly wouldn't consider this highly stable at the moment,
   though I have done a good bit of testing.
   - API for programmatically creating persisted classes
   - Built-in support for persistence of a BlockVector
   - Lots of other thing my brain is too melty too remember right now.

# 0.24

 - Implement /phelp, a universal help system for Persistence plugins
 - Some general bug fixes
 - Add some data to the player class, save last location and orientation

# 0.23

 - Vastly improve Plugin command interface:
 - Support sub-commands
 - Auto-dispatch to individual command handlers
 - Auto-typing with flexible data-driven "sender" system
 - Automatically generated, detailed, explorable help

# 0.22

 - Change contained classes so sub-field names get prefixed.
 - Support containers of containers of containers...
 - Allow for pure contained classes, which don't need an id.

# 0.21

 - Finally support contained lists!
 - Also, fix the server console interface.
 - Extend the Command and Plugin DAOs

# 0.20

 - Massive, massive refactor. No real functionality change, but:
 - All functionality related to creating and populatd classed moved to core.
 - SqlStore only deals with raw database-type actions now.
 - Very, very close to supporting contained references and lists.

# 0.19

 - Fully support Bukkit command interface, you can now use persistence commands from the server console!

# 0.18

 - Integrate Classes plugin directly into Persistence
 - Re organize namespaces for clarity.

# 0.17

 - Update to use the command standard. The persist command is now defined in the YML file.
 - Start work on basic CommandData framework. I'd like to support sub-commands, such as all the sub-commands of /persist,
   and also support auto-generating the help based on this data.
 - Get about halfway there on contained object support.

# 0.16

 - Implement Messaging utility, for consolidated storage of messages and commands.
 - Remove complex jar loading mechanism, use manifest classpath instead. Thanks A LOT, tkelly!
 - Implement contained objects.

# 0.15

 - Escape all table and column names, to allow for entity names with spaces, and also so I can use "group".
 - Support lists of objects.

# 0.14

 - Implement persistence of Lists of primitive objects. Lists of DAO references is not far behind.

# 0.13

 - Implement reload console command, add save command and RESET command.
 - Add list command for data querying.

# 0.12

- Support Lists- not fully functional yet.
- Add basic console UI.

## 0.11

- Support references to other DAO's, including circular class references, for storing structures such as trees.

## 0.10

- First release
- Auto-load JDBC drivers
- Implement support for simple object structure persistence and caching.
